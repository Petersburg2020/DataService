    <body>Turn to the Gospel of Mark, chapter 7, as we continue our expositional tour through this dynamic “Gospel of Action”. We are going to touch on a subject today, that is a very difficult one to preach about. I want you to know that I stand before you with bruised feet, as I have had them walked on all week. The topic that we are going to talk about is hypocrites and hypocrisy in the church. \n\tYou might think, “Great, Pastor, it’s about time you preached on that subject. There are a lot of hypocrites in the world and there are a lot of hypocrites in this church. Go get them! Sock it to them.” \n\tYet, I am afraid that if there is one sin we are all guilty of at times, it is the sin of hypocrisy. I think this message comes at a time when we need to ask ourselves some questions, not only personally, but as a church body. Do we manifest some of the characteristics that Jesus Christ will point His finger at in the lives of these Pharisees? If so, let us clean up today.</body>
    <head>Attitudes Emphasized External Performance Rather Than Inward Purity</head>
    <sub>Look at Mark 7:1-3. </sub>
    <body>The Pharisees and some of the scribes gathered around Him when they had come from Jerusalem, and had seen that some of His disciples were eating their bread with impure hands, that is, unwashed. (For the Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they carefully wash their hands, thus observing the traditions of the elders; “The elders,” in this verse, is referring to ancients, not necessarily elders in church polity. Continue to Mark 7:4. and when they come from the market place, they do not eat unless they cleanse themselves; and there are many other things which they have received in order to observe, such as the washing of cups and pitchers and copper pots.)\n\tI think the first of three characteristics that JESUS CHRIST will reveal, as He rips the mask off these hypocrites, is that their attitudes emphasized external performance rather than inward purity.</body>
